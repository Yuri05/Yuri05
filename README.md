Once upon a time, in a faraway land, people lived a simple life. They looked out over a pasture and said: 'Oh, look, a cow. And there: a horse. Even small children knew what a horse and a cow looked like.<br>
On a whim, the emperor of this land decided to confuse his people and issued a decree that a cow could also be a horse. And a horse could be a cow. <br>
At first, the people shook their heads in amusement. Why should a cow be a horse? They look completely different! Even a small child knows that.<br>
But gradually more and more citizens began to wonder: maybe there was something to this decree after all. If the Emperor says a horse can be a cow and a cow can be a horse, how can we know any better? After all, he is our Emperor. A man of much greater wisdom than we are. He must know better, or he wouldn't be our emperor. <br>
And so it came to pass that fewer and fewer citizens could believe their own eyes. When they looked at the pasture and saw a cow, they said: "It's not at all certain that it's a cow. It might as well be a horse. And when a neighbour replied: "Nonsense, it's a cow, you can see that! They turned away in disgust, doubting his sanity. <br>
When the emperor saw this, he nodded in satisfaction. He went into his palace and laughed and laughed.

In the desert<br>
I saw a creature, naked, bestial,<br>
Who, squatting upon the ground,<br>
Held his heart in his hands,<br>
And ate of it.<br>
I said, “Is it good, friend?”<br>
“It is bitter—bitter,” he answered;<br>

“But I like it<br>
“Because it is bitter,<br>
“And because it is my heart.”<br>

Oh there was a sow who had three little pigs,<br>
There little piggies had she.<br>
The old sow always went "oink, oink, oink,"<br>
and the piggies went "wee, wee, wee-ee-ee."
      
Now one day one of the three little pigs<br>
To the other two piggies said he,<br>
"Why don't we always go oink, oink, oink?<br>
It's so childish to go wee, wee, wee-ee-ee!"    

These three piggies grew skinny and lean,<br>
Skinny they well should be,<br>
For they always would try to go "oink, oink, oink,"<br>
And they wouldn't go "wee, wee, wee-ee-ee."
      
Now there three piggies they up and they died.<br>
A very sad sight to see.<br>
So don't ever try to go "oink, oink, oink,"<br>
When you oughta go "wee, wee, wee-ee-ee!"
