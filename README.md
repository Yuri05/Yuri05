In the desert<br>
I saw a creature, naked, bestial,<br>
Who, squatting upon the ground,<br>
Held his heart in his hands,<br>
And ate of it.<br>
I said, “Is it good, friend?”<br>
“It is bitter—bitter,” he answered;<br>

“But I like it<br>
“Because it is bitter,<br>
“And because it is my heart.”<br>

Oh there was a sow who had three little pigs,<br>
There little piggies had she.<br>
The old sow always went "oink, oink, oink,"<br>
and the piggies went "wee, wee, wee-ee-ee."
      
Now one day one of the three little pigs<br>
To the other two piggies said he,<br>
"Why don't we always go oink, oink, oink?<br>
It's so childish to go wee, wee, wee-ee-ee!"    

These three piggies grew skinny and lean,<br>
Skinny they well should be,<br>
For they always would try to go "oink, oink, oink,"<br>
And they wouldn't go "wee, wee, wee-ee-ee."
      
Now there three piggies they up and they died.<br>
A very sad sight to see.<br>
So don't ever try to go "oink, oink, oink,"<br>
When you oughta go "wee, wee, wee-ee-ee!"
